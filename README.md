AuctionApp
==========

Node Js Server For Item Auctioning

This is the Node.js server code that uses the NET framework.

It communicates with clients running a seperate Windows desktop application. 

The application was built to practice creating protocols and using TCP and UDP sockets. 

It streams image and text between a node server and multiple clients. 

The goal of this project was to develop:

- A Windows desktop application in C# that allowed multiple users to engage in a realtime auction. 
- To host all auction items and users on a Node.js server.
